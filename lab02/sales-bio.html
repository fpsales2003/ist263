        <h1>Francis Sales' Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>My name is Francis Sales. I’m a Sophomore at <strong>Syracuse University</strong> studying Information Management and Technology. I’ve got proficient skills in the Adobe Suite and multiple programming language (including python, HTML, CSS, XCode and Java). Some of my accomplishments throughout my professional career include organizing and running a large part of a hometown fair multiple years in a row as well as redesigning and creating 3 websites for a real estate company I interned with for a summer. Outside of this I enjoy working out, playing guitar, and watching TV. Some of my favorite shows and movies are Futurama, Parks and Recs, and Napoleon Dynamite.</p>
